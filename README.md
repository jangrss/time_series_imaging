Main respository for the IEEE article "Benchmarking Transfer Learning Strategies In Time-Series Imaging: Recommendations for Analyzing Raw Sensor Data"

/src: main code
/data: datasets (/CSVs) and extracted GAFs for investigated datasets
/graphics: extracted figures for benchmarking evaluation (see: gross2022a_benchmarking_transfer_learning_strategies_IEEE.pdf)

Trained model files are not available in the remote repository and need to be extracted using training with the main code
