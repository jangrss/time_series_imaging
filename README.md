# Time Series Imaging <br />
Main respository for the IEEE article "Benchmarking Transfer Learning Strategies In Time-Series Imaging: Recommendations for Analyzing Raw Sensor Data" <br />

/src: main code <br />
/data: datasets (/CSVs) and extracted GAFs for investigated datasets <br />
/graphics: extracted figures for benchmarking evaluation (see: gross2022a_benchmarking_transfer_learning_strategies_IEEE.pdf) <br />
<br />
Trained model files are not available in the remote repository and need to be extracted using training with the main code
